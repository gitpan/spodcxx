hmmsdlkjhfakljhfakdlfs [Lets link this] .

OK, WE still need to _parse_ the end [http://www.google.com google here!] of a line the right way.
Yeah, but http://www.google.nl is a good SearchMachine, although <= all other

Ja, #En nu kijken of we verder komen#. Inderdaad.

Let's see what we !*must* do with a word followed by a colon:
 Now, for some *verbatim* text.
 This text should not be parsed.
And the next line should be spaced.
dsfkhask [test.jpg] HMM.

Ok, a WikiWikiWikiWord can be escaped; !WikiWikiWikiWord; as you see.

* *List one*
* Linst one

0 List two
0 List two
00 Ja Ja
00 Nene
0 OK
